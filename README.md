# CTA
A compiler from CTA language to C++, written in JavaScript.

# What does it stand for?
Compiles To Anything

# Why?
I wanted to make a language that has some features built-in
 - NumPy-like arrays (dynamic, allow operations directly on them)
 - C-like syntax that's easier and shorter to write
 - Strongly typed for compile-time type checking (which sould lead to less errors) 
 - very speed
