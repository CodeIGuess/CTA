# CTA (Compiles To Anything)
A language that's inspired by Python, Java, and C.

This repo is a compiler from CTA to C++

# Why?
I wanted to make a language that has some features built-in
 - NumPy-like arrays (dynamic, allow operations directly on them)
 - C-like syntax that's easier and shorter to write
 - Strongly typed for compile-time type checking (which sould lead to less errors) 
 - very speed
