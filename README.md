# CTA (Compiles To Anything) Language
CTA is a high-level programming language that's inspired by Python, Java, and C.

I wanted to make a language that has some features built-in
 - NumPy-like arrays that are dynamic, and allow operations to be done directly on them (as if they were a single value)
 - C-like syntax that's easier and shorter to write
 - Strongly typed for compile-time type checking, which lead to less errors, and lets the compiler work for other strongly-typed languages

# Why does it exist?
The main reason for making this was the need for code to run on every platform, which is solved by making it compile to multiple languages.

# Is it good for anything specific?
Yes, it's all been coded with graphics in mind. The the same code that can (eventually) work on browsers can also work on OpenGL, PyGame, or any other language.

The aim is to make everything work equally across all compilation targets.
